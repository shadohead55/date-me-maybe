# Date Me, Maybe?

**Date Me, Maybe?** is a tiny browser-based idle dating sim built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Earn cash and love during the day then spend your nights going on dates!

## Features

- Simple clicker mechanics using JavaScript
- Day/night cycle that toggles every 30 seconds
- Basic sprites for the player and partner
- Minimalistic pixel-art inspired UI

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser and start clicking. As you earn cash and love points, you'll unlock the ability to go on a date at night.

## How to Play

1. During the day, press **Do Self-Care** to earn cash and love.
2. When night falls, and if you have at least 10 cash and 10 love, the **Go on Date** button becomes active.
3. Each date costs 10 cash but rewards you with extra love.

## Project Structure

```
css/        # Stylesheet
js/         # Game logic
index.html  # Main game page
```

The game is intentionally lightweight and requires no build step or serverâ€”just a modern web browser.
